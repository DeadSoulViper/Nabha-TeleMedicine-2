        *   The flow sends the data and a detailed system prompt to the **Google Gemini model**.
        *   The AI analyzes the information.
        *   The model returns a structured JSON object with potential conditions, severity, and recommendations.

        *   The model returns a boolean (`isGenuine`) and a corrected name.
    6.  **Output (Conditional):**
        *   **If `isGenuine` is true:**
